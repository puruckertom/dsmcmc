## Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Metropolis Hasting Sampler

This is a simple tutorial to illustrate how to use R to combine a dateset of interest with a model and generate posterior distributions of parameters of interest. 


## Data set

We will first import a dataset that has an observation of interest with covariates. In this case, we will use pesticide body burdens in amphibians. We will combine this with a model that also 
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
